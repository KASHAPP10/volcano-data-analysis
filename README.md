#  Volcano Data Analysis Project

A simple data science project using Python to explore real-world volcano data.  
This analysis identifies the countries with the most volcanoes and the tallest volcanoes and calculates average elevations using filtering, sorting, and basic visualization.

##  What I Did
- Loaded and explored a volcano dataset using Pandas
- Filtered volcanoes by country and elevation
- Identified the top 3 tallest volcanoes
- Calculated average elevation across different subsets
- Created bar charts to visualize the top countries by volcano count

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Sample Visualization

##  How to Use
1. Download the notebook and dataset (`volcanoes.csv`)
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`volcano_analysis.ipynb`)
3. Run each cell step-by-step to see the analysis

##  What I Learned
## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- Learned that the USA has the highest number of volcanoes in the dataset, which may reflect its active geological zones, like Alaska and the Pacific Northwest
- Noticed that several of the worldâ€™s tallest volcanoes are located in Africa and Asia, emphasizing the global distribution of high-altitude volcanic activity
- Discovered that many countries have volcanoes below 2000 meters, which may not be as tall but can still pose serious eruption risks near populated areas
- Gained insight into how simple data filtering and sorting can surface meaningful patterns in natural disaster data, which can help inform emergency preparedness, scientific research, and educational outreach
- Realized the importance of clean, well-structured datasets for answering geographical and scientific questions effectively
